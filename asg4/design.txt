Purpose:
This documents specifies the single instance storage server, created with the use of deduplication.
Files are broken into blocks and stored into a hash table.  

Assumptions:
1. The program will be ran on UNIX
2. The user will know how to execute the program

Data Library:
1. _size
	- global size passed in by Initialize to specify number of slots 
	in hash table

2. _length
	- global length passed in by Initialize to specify the length of each
	slot in hash table

3. fd 
	-global file descriptor passed in by Initialize to specify file

4. magic_num
	-the magic number is inserted at the beginning of each slot in the hashtable
	it is used to tell whether the slot is full or empty

5.tombstone
	-when we delete a key/value, we need a tombstone to tell an item was deleted.
	we use this to keep searching through the hash table for a key until an empty
	spot is found.  For insert, if we find an empty spot without a key match, we insert
	the key into the slot where tombstone is. Without a tombstone, we would encounter 
	problems with keys not being found when they are indeed in the table and to avoid
	duplicate key inserts.

6. hashkey
	-this takes the hash of a key and mods it by size.  This will give us a slot that 
	is inside the table

7.check_key
	-read in the key into check key.  if strcmp is 0, then there is a key match in the hash table

8.check
	-reads in the first 4 bytes where the magic number is, it is then compared with check_dead/check_tomb

9.check_dead
	-we do memcmp with check.  if it is 0 then we know the magic number is in current slot

10.check_tomb
	-we do memcmp with check.  if it is 0 then we know the tombstone is in current slot

11.prober
	-hahskey found from probe, if -1 then key/value not in table

Data Server/materialize/ingest:
1. listenfd
	- Value for the listen file descriptor

2. connfd
	- Value for the connection file descriptor for connected socket

3. n
	- Checks the status of the read() and write() functions

4. line[MAXLINE+1], printAll[MAXLINE+1], and recvline[MAXLINE+1]
	- Stores data to be sent or received between the hosts

5. AF_INET
	- Specifies the communication protocol used

6. SOCK_STREAM
	- Specifies the type of socket

7. sockaddr
	- Socket address structures to cast pointers

8. servaddr
	- Stores the server address

9. sockfd
	- Socket file descriptor returned from a previous socket()

10. logfile
	-when hashtable is created, ptr points to value in logfile
	
11. hashtable
	-initialized to size of 2000 with block length 100
	
12. md5key
	-block is md5'd resulting in 128 bit encrypted key

13. fdin
	-read in original file

14. fdout
	-output file for recipe

15. filepath
	-obtaining path of file

16. recipe
	-contains block length, size, location, file name, and md5keys

read in the original file
output file for recipe
obtain stats/path/permission of the file
while{
convert buffer into md5 key
send insert info to server
send md5 keys out for the recipe
get server response
clear buffer
break out of loop when nothing to read}

Materialize Algorithm:
create socket
operating system initiates TCP three way connections
open recipe file
parse into 3 pieces
while line !null{
fetch value to write
write it}

Server:
Create socket
bind operating system that links port number to process
listen to operating system to accept connections
wait for connection
create table and logfile

	if insert called from client
		break into 3 pieces
		append block data into the logfile
		insert md5 key into hash table
	if fetch 
		break into 3 pieces
